The puzzle files on your devices if any are listed in the My Puzzles section and you can choose one to start playing. If you do not have an SD Card, you can open the file from your File Manager directly. You get a clue to each puzzle and you need to enter your answer in the text box. If your answer is correct you can go to the next puzzle or you can skip the current puzzle. Happy cracking!</string>
